# Gains-Grains

What was your motivation? 
We wanted to create something that simple and interactive for all new and established gym goers and health conscious people. 

Why did you build this?
Health and wellness is an industry with a vast number of resources, which may come off as intimidating to anyone who doesn’t have an already established routine. We built ‘Gains and Grains’ to contain all that information in one place and make easier for people to blend both their nutritional and workout goals, all while building a community of supportive and motivated people.

What problem does it solve? 
It solves the problem of confusion due to the abundance of resources. This way your journey becomes less intimidating.

What did you learn? 
We learned that it is very important for each person to have assigned tasks and asking for help is so necessary. Without the TAs’ help, we would not have been able to get as far as we did.
